- Autonomous appointment: With the customer's permission, the robot autonomously makes an appointment with the customer regarding the background information of the real estate, such as transaction intention, property size, budget, purchase plan, etc. The entire process is carried out autonomously by the robot.

- Information summary: After the appointment process is completed, the robot automatically summarizes the customer's background information and writes it into the database. It also provides a query interface for the business system to use.
